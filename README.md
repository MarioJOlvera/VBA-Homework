# WallStreet Analysis with VBA

This project was aimed to design a code for analyzing real stock market data from excel files. This project is divided by three modules: 

- Module_1: returns the yearly overview of all the tickers listed.

- Module_2: returns the greatest increase and decrease value stock, 
            as well as the the maximum stock total from all the tickers listed,
            after the Module_1 was ejecuted.

- Module_3: is the main sub routine wich calls the previous modules and the iteration
            between all the sheets of a workbook.
